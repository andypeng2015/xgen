The standard 32-bit ARM calling convention allocates the 15
general-purpose registers as:
  r14 is the link register. (The BL instruction, used in a subroutine
  call, stores the return address in this register).
  r13 is the stack pointer. (The Push/Pop instructions in "Thumb"
  operating mode use this register only).
  r12 is the Intra-Procedure-call scratch register.
  r4 to r11: used to hold local variables.
  r0 to r3: used to hold argument values passed to a subroutine,
  and also hold results returned from a subroutine.

Condition codes
	The instructions that can be conditional have an optional condition code, shown in syntax
	descriptions as  {cond} . Table 3-2 shows the condition codes that you can use

	Suffix Meaning
	EQ     Equal
	NE     Not equal
	CS     Carry set (identical to HS)
	HS     Unsigned higher or same (identical to CS)
	CC      Carry clear (identical to LO)
	LO     Unsigned lower (identical to CC)
	MI     Minus or negative result
	PL     Positive or zero result
	VS     Overflow
	VC     No overflow
	HI     Unsigned higher
	LS     Unsigned lower or same
	GE     Signed greater than or equal
	LT     Signed less than
	GT     Signed greater than
	LE     Signed less than or equal
	AL     Always (this is the default)
