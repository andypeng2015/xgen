/*
For the case, we can not hoist x+y always up, because we
should consider the variable life time of x and y.
(e.g: hoist x+y to BB1, of cause, the BB1 is the
best position which x+y should be moved to just only at this case.)
So you must use ANTI-IN, and AVAIABLE-IN info to compute the
EARLIEST.
Or you must design a new method that either hoist expression or
considering the variable's life time, that is what the LCM did.
